The website looked like it was from the early 2,000's ran at a snail's pace and had a way to many pages, in fact, it is still up right now 2uper.com. I began with modernizing the website with a moving carousel and a shop button that grabs the attention of the user. Then I broke the pages down to two pages and a drop-down of shop classes. The less clicks the better. I also added a contact page so the client can be easily contacted and improved overall performance. The client is still gathering information for the store.",

    bio: "I noticed many local barbershops do no have websites in my area. So I decided to take advantage of this and create a simple website for new customers to see available barbers and easily book them. This site has a book me a button that would direct users to their Booksy profile to book an appointment from the first page customers can see the barbers experience and when they work. I also added a page that shows the pricing for each service with a brief description. Knowing this place is Hard to find I included a Google Map API that in two  clicks from the homepage gives you directions to the barbershop",
