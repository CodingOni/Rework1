    bio: "This site is a rework of a clients attempt at creating their website. The website looked like it was from the early 2,000's ran at a snail's pace and had a way to many pages, in fact, it is still up right now 2uper.com. I began with modernizing the website with a moving carousel and a shop button that grabs the attention of the user. Then I broke the pages down to two pages and a drop-down of shop classes. The less clicks the better. I also added a contact page so the client can be easily contacted and improved overall performance. The client is still gathering information for the store.",
