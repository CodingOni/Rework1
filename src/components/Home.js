        <p className="about">Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. I have always been a computer guy I remember inspecting elements in middle school and changing some text and thinking I hacked the school website. To then creating my own website with basic HTML and CSS in high school. </p>
        <br/>
        <p className="about">From there I decided to go to college for Computer Science where I studied languages like C++ and learned how to think like a programmer. The ability to create things you think of into a real space fascinates me. I love solving problems and being creative so programming is perfect for me it seems as it has always been a part of my life. Currently, I am learning more frameworks next I plan to learn back-end and in a few years delv into machine learning.</p>
